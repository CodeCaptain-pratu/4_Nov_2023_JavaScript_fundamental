QUESTION:Describe the categorization of operators in JavaScript based on their functionality. Provide examples for each category.
Answer : 
In JavaScript, operators can be categorized based on their functionality into the following categories:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
- These operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc
- Examples:
- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b`
- Modulus: `a % b`

2. Assignment Operators:
- These operators are used to assign a value to a variable
- Examples:
- Assignment: `a = b`
- Addition and assignment: `a += b`
- Subtraction and assignment: `a -= b`
- Multiplication and assignment: `a *= b`
- Division and assignment: `a /= b`
- Modulus and assignment: `a %= b`

3. Comparison Operators:
- These operators are used to compare two values
- Examples:
- Equal to: `a == b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`

4. Logical Operators:
- These operators are used to perform logical operations like AND, OR, NOT
- Examples:
- AND: `a && b`
- OR: `a || b`
- NOT: `!a`

5. Bitwise Operators:
- These operators are used to perform bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Examples:
- AND: `a & b`
- OR: `a | b`
- XOR: `a ^ b`
- NOT: `~a`

6. String Operators:
- These operators are used to concatenate strings
- Examples:
- Concatenation: `a + b`

7. Conditional Operators:
- These operators are used to perform conditional operations like ternary operator
- Examples:
- Ternary operator: `a ? b : c`

8. Unary Operators:
- These operators are used to perform operations on a single operand
- Examples:
- Increment: `a++`
- Decrement: `a--`
- Negation: `-a`

9. Ternary Operator:
- This operator is used to perform a conditional operation
- Example: `a ? b : c`
